#**OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING**

###Encapsulation:
"To wrap a piece of code up in a function. One of the benefits
of encapsulation is that it attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of
documentation. Another advantage is that if you reuse the code, it is more concise to
call a function twice than to copy and paste the body!" (Downey)
